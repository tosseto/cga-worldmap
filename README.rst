 WorldMap
=========

Build Requirements
==================

Before starting work on WorldMap, you will need to have the following
software installed and in your PATH:

* The git command-line client, version 1.5.3 or higher:
  - To verify that it is available, run ``git --version`` and verify the
    version is something like ``git version 1.6.6.1``
  - If not, you can download one of the installers from http://git-scm.com/ or
    from your operating system provider.

* The Subversion command-line client, version 1.5 or higher.
  - To verify that is is available, run ``svn --version`` and verify the output
    starts with something like ``svn, version 1.6.9 (r901367)``
  - If not, you can find the appropriate installer at
    http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html

* The GEOS geometry handling library: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/

* The GDAL geographic raster access library: http://www.gdal.org/

* The OGR geographic vector data access library: http://www.gdal.org/ogr/

* Sun Java Development Kit 1.5 or Higher: 
  - To verify that it is available, run
    ``javac -help -version`` and verify that it reports a list of usage flags,
    ending with a line like ``javac 1.5.0_18`` (the numbers will vary with your
    installed version).
  - If not, download from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp 
    (Make sure to install the *JDK*!) 

* Python 2.6:
  - To verify that it is available, run 
    ``python --version`` and verify that it reports a version number like
    ``Python 2.6``
  - If not, download from http://python.org/download/
  - Python must be compiled w/ SSL support and sqlite support to
    support the WorldMap development setup.  Installing the sqlite and
    openssl development headers before building Python will suffice.

* Apache Maven 2.0.10 or Later:
  - To verify that it is available, run
    ``mvn -version`` and verify that it reports version information like::
        
      Maven version: 2.0.10
      Java version: 1.5.0_18
      OS name: "linux" version: "2.6.30.8-64.fc11.x86_64" arch: "amd64" Family: "unix"

  - If not, download from http://maven.apache.org/download.html

* Apache Tomcat 6.x or Jetty

Additionally, WorldMap uses a number of native-code libraries in Python.  You
can install these libraries manually, or allow the WorldMap setup script to
compile them for you.   In the latter case, you will need to install a C
compiler such as GCC, as well as any requisite development libraries.  GCC
packages are available for Mac OSX and all Linux distributions; consult your
operating system provider for installation instructions.

The native libraries needed include:

* PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

* ReportLab http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/

* simplejson http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/

For GCC, packages are available for Mac OSX and all Linux distributions;
consult your operating system provider for installation instructions.  When
build PIL from source, ensure that you have development libraries available for
libpng, libjpeg, and libgif if you want to be able to use those formats in your
WorldMap site.

Install
=======

The following steps should prepare a Python virtual environment for you::

  git clone git://github.com/cga-harvard/cga-worldmap.git cga-worldmap
  cd cga-worldmap
  git submodule update --init
  python bootstrap.py --no-site-packages # see note below
  source bin/activate
  paver build
  django-admin.py createsuperuser --settings=geonode.settings


Copy these war files to the webapps directory of your Java container
(Tomcat/Jetty) and deploy them:
    webapps/geoserver-geonode-dev.war
    webapps/geonetwork.war


Start the server:
  paver host


Once fully started, you should see a message indicating the address of your WorldMap::
  
  Development GeoNode is running at http://localhost:8000/
  The GeoNode is an unstoppable machine
  Press CTRL-C to shut down


.. note:: 

  When running ``python bootstrap.py`` the ``--no-site-packages`` option is
  not required.  If enabled, the bootstrap script will sandbox your virtual
  environment from any packages that are installed in the system, useful if
  you have incompatible versions of libraries such as Django installed
  system-wide.  On the other hand, sometimes it is useful to use a version of
  ReportLab or the Python Imaging Library provided by your operating system
  vendor, or packaged other than on PyPI.  When in doubt, however, just leave
  this option in.


This command::

  django-admin.py createsuperuser --settings=geonode.settings

can be used to create additional administrative user accounts.  The administrative control panel is not
linked from the main site, but can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/admin/

Options
=======

For JavaScript Developers
-------------------------

Minified Scripts
................

JavaScript Developers can switch to using unminified scripts and CSS:

1. Get and run geonode-client:

<<<<<<< HEAD
to update the built script directories for the base WorldMap site and the CAPRA
extensions, respectively.
=======
    $ git clone git://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-client.git geonode-client
    $ cd geonode-client
    $ ant init debug

2. Set the GEONODE_CLIENT_LOCATION entry in :file:`src/geonode/settings.py` to
   ``http://localhost:8080/`` and run paver as described above.

Note that this requires ant (http://ant.apache.org/) in addition to the above
build requirements.

VirtualBox Setup
................

To test the application in different browsers in VirtualBox guests, the
following needs to be done before running ``paver host``:

* Start the guest in VirtualBox. Set the network adapter mode to
  "Host-only adapter". Then set it back to "NAT".

* On the host, do ifconfig and write down the IP address of the vboxnet0
  adapter.

* Edit :file:`src/GeoNodePy/geonode/settings.py` and change the line::

    GEOSERVER_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/geoserver-geonode-dev/"

  to use the IP address you have written down above::

    GEOSERVER_BASE_URL="http://192.168.56.1:8001/geoserver-geonode-dev/"

* Make sure to change other http://localhost urls in
  :file:`src/GeoNodePy/geonode/settings.py` accordingly as well

* To start the web server, run::

    $ paver host -b 192.168.56.1

* Now WorldMap is available in your browser at http://192.168.56.1:8000/


For Java Developers
-------------------

How WorldMap Finds GeoServer
...........................

Java Developers can point the application at a particular GeoServer instance by
setting the GEOSERVER_BASE_URL entry in settings.py to the context path of the
GeoServer instance.  This should include the trailing slash.  For example, the
GeoServer used for http://geonode.capra.opengeo.org/ is::

    http://geonode.capra.opengeo.org/geoserver/

The default value is ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver-geonode-dev/``.

If you want to change this service URL, edit :file:`src/geonode/settings.py` and
change the line::
  
    GEOSERVER_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/geoserver-geonode-dev/"

to indicate the GeoServer URL that you want to use. 


Alternative GeoServer Data Directories
......................................

This server defaults to using :file:`gs-data/` as the data directory by default.
If you need you need to use an alternative data directory, you can specify it
by editing ``startup.sh`` to specify a different data directory::
 
    -DGEOSERVER_DATA_DIR=/home/me/mydata/ 

For Deployment
--------------

Email
.....

Adding an email gateway to WorldMap can be very useful, the two main reasons are
the ``ADMINS`` and ``REGISTRATION_OPEN`` settings explained below.

Here is a sample configuration to setup a Gmail account as the email gateway::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'foo@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'bar'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

More informacion can be found in the django docs::

    http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/?from=olddocs#email-backend

ADMINS
......

When ``DEBUG=False`` django will not display the usual error page, but will
email the people in the ADMINS tuple with the error traceback::

    ADMINS = (
        ('Carlos Valderrama', 'carlos.valderrama@gmail.com'),
        ('Diego Maradona', 'diego.maradona@gmail.com'),
    )

REGISTRATION_OPEN
.................

In order to let people autoregister to the WorldMap, set::

    REGISTRATION_OPEN=True

This needs email to be configured and your website's domain name properly set in
the Sites application (the default is example.com)::

    http://localhost:8000/admin/sites/site/1


POSTGIS_DATASTORE
.................
To import uploaded shapefiles to PostGIS, manually create a PostGIS datastore in GeoServer
and assign its name to the 'POSTGIS_DATASTORE' value in settings.py
Then assign the appropriate connection values to the other POSTGIS_ settings (necessary for deleting
PostGIS tables when layers in WorldMap are deleted).


TILE CACHING
.............
Create or edit the 'gwc-gs.xml' file under the gwc directory within your GeoServer data directory:
<GeoServerGWCConfig>
   <directWMSIntegrationEnabled>true</directWMSIntegrationEnabled>
   <WMSCEnabled>true</WMSCEnabled>
   <WMTSEnabled>true</WMTSEnabled>
   <TMSEnabled>true</TMSEnabled>
   <cacheLayersByDefault>true</cacheLayersByDefault>
   <cacheNonDefaultStyles>true</cacheNonDefaultStyles>
   <metaTilingX>4</metaTilingX>
   <metaTilingY>4</metaTilingY>
   <defaultCachingGridSetIds>
     <string>EPSG:900913</string>
   </defaultCachingGridSetIds>
   <defaultCoverageCacheFormats>
     <string>image/jpeg</string>
   </defaultCoverageCacheFormats>
   <defaultVectorCacheFormats>
     <string>image/png</string>
   </defaultVectorCacheFormats>
   <defaultOtherCacheFormats>
     <string>image/png</string>
   </defaultOtherCacheFormats>
</GeoServerGWCConfig>


Also, if using Tomcat, add the following line to your catalaina.sh file:
    CATALINA_OPTS="-DGWC_METASTORE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:h2:file:/<path to meta_jdbc_h2>"
    where "meta_jdbc_h2" should be a directory under the gwc directory mentioned above.
